            <div>
                    As an accommodation to consumers, the Tribe has established the following Tribal Dispute Resolution Procedure to receive, review,
                    and consider any and all types of complaints made by or on behalf of our consumers. A consumer who, in the course of his or her
                    otherwise lawful and proper use of our business, has concerns about the operation of any part of Us or who otherwise believes himself
                    or herself to be aggrieved by some aspect of any part of our operation shall direct his or her concerns in the first instance to our
                    management, in writing at PH@PortfolioEmail. A consumer's complaint to Us shall be
                    considered similar in nature to a petition for redress submitted to a sovereign government, without waiver of sovereign immunity and
                    exclusive jurisdiction, and does not create any binding procedural or substantive rights. We will investigate the consumer's complaint
                    and provide Our initial determination as soon as is reasonably practicable. In the event that the consumer is dissatisfied with Our initial
                    determination, then he or she may request review of our initial determination by submitting such request in writing to the Tribal
                    Financial Services Regulatory Authority ("Authority") at P.O. Box 783, Lac du Flambeau, WI 54538 no later than 90 days after
                    receiving our initial determination.                    
            </div>
            <div>
                    The Authority may offer the consumer an opportunity to be heard and the consumer may be represented by legal counsel at his or her
                    own expense. If a hearing is granted, it will take place no less than 10 days and no more than 60 days after the Authority receives the
                    consumer's written request. The Authority will notify the consumer in writing with its opinion regarding Our initial determination.                    
            </div>
            <div>
                    A consumer may appeal an Authority opinion by filing a written appeal to the Tribal Court within 20 days of receiving the Authority's
                    final written opinion in accordance with the rules of court and procedures of the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Court.
